AI-ssistant is a web-based personal assistant application that supports common Google Assistant tasks, as well as unique add-on features. Our web application aims to make assistant technologies easily accessible to all users through a web browser, rather than a smart device. Additionally, by providing both textual and audio interactions, we hope to support a wider audience with varying accessibility levels. Our ultimate goal is to create an easy online tool that provides useful services, organizes and shares information, and performs helpful and supportive tasks. We designed and developed the AI-ssistant during our STEP internship at Google, Summer 2020.

We created this full-stack web application using a variety of Google APIs and services, including: Dialogflow, Text To Speech, Speech to Text, Translate, Google Maps, Timezone, Geocoding, OAuth 2.0, People API, Google Books API, Youtube Data API and Datastore. AI-ssistant is written in Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used Dialogflow, a natural understanding platform, to create intents, entities, and training phrases. The Dialogflow folder contains this data. From our inputted training phrases, Dialogflow is able to detect user intent from a user inputted audio stream. Based on the detected intent, our system determines which agent should handle creating the apporpriate fulfilment, which is sent to the Text to Speech API and outputted to the user, and display information to be placed on the user interface.

**Add-On Features:**

The **Books Feature** creates a social books experience that allows users to discover and share books with their friends through our AI-ssistant. The Books Feature has four main functionalities. First, users can like books, browse through a feed of their friends’ liked books, and navigate to users’ profiles to see their likes. Second, users can perform searches to discover books that match their specifications, filtering by title, category, language, type (magazine, book, etc.), ebook (paid or free), author, or bookshelf. Third, for each book displayed by the AI-ssistant, users can request for a description or an embedded preview of the book, allowing them to learn more about the book directly on the AI-ssitant interface. Finally, our assistant can manage users’ Google Books accounts by adding books to or deleting books from their private bookshelves.
